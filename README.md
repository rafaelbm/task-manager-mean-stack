# Task Manager App

This repository contains the code for both Angular frontend application as well as the NodeJS API.
I coded this following along this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIjdNHWULhPSZFDzQU6AnbVQNNo1NTRpd).

The original [repository](https://github.com/Devstackr/task-manager-mean-stack) from the author of the playlist

## Setup

Run `npm install` in both the **api** and **frontend** folders

We depend upon MongoDB, if you have it installed on your machine you are most likely good to go. Otherwise, if you have **Docker** installed on your machine, you can use the `docker-compose.yml` to spin-up a MongoDB Docker container.

## Running

Run `node app.js` in the **api** folder to run the NodeJS API

Run `ng  serve` in the **frontend** folder to run the Angular frontend

Open a browser and navigate to **http://localhost:4200**
